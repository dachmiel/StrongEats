Flutter allows developers to publish projects to the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, but it requires a payment which we do not have the funds to support. So, we recommend installing the development kit and a phone emulator to run the application on.

Users must install the following on their devices to run application:
Install Flutter 
Flutter is the framework used to build the application.
Download Flutter to your operating system via instructions at the given link: Install | Flutter. Follow the instructions for your operating system.
When installed, run the command “flutter doctor” in your terminal. This automatically checks on any dependencies for the installation of flutter. Instructions to clear any errors are attached to the doctor output.
For any issues with installing flutter on macOS, please refer to this video.

Follow the instructions for your desired operating system to emulate the application.

Windows
Install Android Studio
Download Android Studio & App Tools - Android Developers
From here, you can set up an Android Emulator by the instructions from the previous link (Install | Flutter)’
Install Firebase
Add Firebase to your Flutter app (google.com)
From this link, only follow the instructions through Step 1. There will be a link with some downloads, and other commands to run to set up Firebase
Once the emulator is created…
Run the emulator on its own
With the emulator running, cd into the “strongeats_app” file directory
In your terminal set to “strongeats_app” directory, type “flutter run” command
Enjoy the app!
MacOS
Install Xcode
Xcode is an integrated development environment for macOS that provides tools for building software for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

Once installed, open Xcode and accept all agreements.
Install Cocoapods
CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. It is used to manage the dependencies of your Xcode project.
Download CocoaPods to your operating system via “sudo gem install cocoapods” command in the terminal.
Setup iOS Simulator
Follow the instructions in this video from 6:24-8:00.
Running the Application:
Users can check if all is installed with the command “flutter doctor” in the terminal as it shows information about the installed tooling. 
If all is installed correctly, make sure the simulator is open and check that visual studio code detects the simulator and it is properly connected by looking for ios simulator in the bottom right corner. 
Use the terminal to cd into the proper folder “strongeats_app” before typing the command “flutter run” to start the program.
